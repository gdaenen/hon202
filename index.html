    <h1>HIntroduction</h1>      
    <p>In the abstract, student life provides unique opportunities to read, discuss and critique political theory as well as engage in political organization and action. These opportunities have been historically identified (example: Walter Benjaminâ€™s early essay The Life of Students) and seized upon (student movements of 1968, etc), which gives us some idea of what the role of the student left has been in the past and the importance of students to left struggle. If the university is understood as a key site of left activity historically, studying it today should tell us something about the state of the left broadly (movements start on campuses/they serve as incubators), as well as something about the extent to which students today are able to take up the unique political opportunities presented by student life.</p>
